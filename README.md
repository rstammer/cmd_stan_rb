## ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention: This repository is no longer maintained actively

Hi everyone! There's a very similar and well-shaped Ruby gem, [cmdstan-ruby](https://github.com/ankane/cmdstan-ruby). To not waste precious development energy, I decided not to 
continue active development of my own Ruby gem and want everyone encourage to use and contribute to [cmdstan-ruby](https://github.com/ankane/cmdstan-ruby) instead to 
enhance the Bayesian modeling world with Ruby further. 

However - you are free to use or get inspired by anything you find here!

Thanks for your understanding!
Robin Stammer 

## Installation

    gem install cmd_stan_rb

## Installation for IRuby notebooks

    gem install cmd_stan_rb

‚Ä¶ and then re-register your Ruby kernel by

    iruby register --force

## Before you can start‚Ä¶

This project makes use of [CmdStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan) to compile models
with the Stan compiler and incorporating additional tooling from the Stan ecosystem. There
are battle-tested similar projects for other Programming languages are i.e.

  * [CmdStanPy](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanpy)
  * [CmdStanR](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr)
  * [stannis](https://github.com/sakrejda/stannis])

Because of its dependency to `CmdStan`, you need to get `CmdStan` on board to
make `CmdStanRb` work. In the future I'd like to happen this automatically, but
for now you need to do this manually.

The easiest way is cloning the repository to a location of your choice. I'd
recommend moving it inside the directory of `cmd_stan_rb` under a subfolder
named `vendor`:


    cd cmd_stan_rb && mkdir vendor && cd vendor && git clone https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan

Then, remember the path to that directory, as we need CmdStanRb to point
to that directory by setting a config variable

Sometimes you have to `cd` into your `cmdstan` directory and run

    git submodule update --init --recursive

## Usage

To see some examples with detailed context, you may want to consult [one of the example jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/neumanrq/cmd_stan_rb/tree/master/examples). I.e, [here's how one performs linear regression](https://github.com/neumanrq/cmd_stan_rb/blob/master/examples/linear_regression.ipynb) with CmdStandRb. If you like monkeys and pirates, check the [example of an A/B test by fitting models based on exponential distribution](https://github.com/neumanrq/cmd_stan_rb/blob/master/examples/exponential.ipynb).

```Ruby
# Tell CmdStanRb where your CmdStan repository is located.
# If you skip this step, the default value is "vendor/cmdstan"
CmdStanRb.configuration.cmdstan_dir = "~/path/to/cmdstan"

# Optional: Tell CmdStanRb where to store the models
CmdStanRb.configuration.model_dir = "/Users/robin/cmd_stan_rb-models"

# Prepare Stan compiler and assistent tooling
CmdStanRb.build_binaries

# Now we're ready to fit some models üë®‚Äçüî¨
# First, define your model. The first argument is a name,
# which is used to identify your model for re-use later.
model =
  Stan::Model.new("bernoulli-test") do
    # Stan code goes here as a string
    %q{
      data {
        int<lower=0> N;
        int<lower=0,upper=1> y[N];
      }

      parameters {
        real<lower=0,upper=1> theta;
      }

      model {
        theta ~ beta(1,1);  // uniform prior on interval 0,1
        y ~ bernoulli(theta);
      }
    }
  end

# Translate model
model.compile

# Specify data you've observed
model.data = {
  "N" => 4,
  "y" => [0,1,0,0]
}

# Run simulation to obtain samples from posterior distribution
result = model.fit(warmup: 500, samples: 2000) # Arguments are optional

# Print result
puts model.show
```

The latter command shows the simulation result:


    Inference for Stan model: b439_model
    1 chains: each with iter=(1000); warmup=(0); thin=(1); 1000 iterations saved.

    Warmup took (0.0062) seconds, 0.0062 seconds total

    Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
    For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
    and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at
    convergence, R_hat=1).

### Diving deeper into the model output

The return value of `model.fit`, called `posterior` below, holds all (sampled) posterior distributions
for each parameter, like `theta`. For each parameter there is a method generated with the same name. The
method returns a Ruby Hash reflecting the sampled posterior distribution of that parameter.

### Loading previously compiled models

CmdStanRb stores models in a diretory you can define by

```Ruby
CmdStanRb.configuration.model_dir = "/Users/robin/cmd_stan_rb-models"
```

If you skip this, CmdStanRb will create a folder in your home directory named `cmd_stan_rb-models` and store
the model files and the compiled model binaries there.

Having compiled a model with name `my-model-01`, you can load it again by

```Ruby
model = Stan::Model.load("my-model-01")
```

Note that once loaded, the model's data has been wiped out, so `model.data` is blank and
needs to get set again to fit again.
